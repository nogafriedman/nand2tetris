# Nand2Tetris – Course Projects (2024)

This repository contains my solutions to the Nand2Tetris course, completed during my Computer Science degree in 2024.  
The course walks through the process of building a complete computer system from first principles — starting with a single logic gate (NAND) and culminating in a working hardware simulator, assembler, virtual machine, and high-level programming language.
